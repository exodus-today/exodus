# exodus
We are facing an increase in the number of people who need financial assistance to provide basic needs. 
Today, such assistance is carried out in friends' family circles everywhere, but potential opportunities
are limited by the number of participants in such communities. Network self-organization of financial
mutual assistance is possible using an application that takes into account and dispatches the mutual 
obligations of voluntary participants - donors and acceptors. In this case, conditions arise for an
alternative decentralized social protection system based on the principles of mutual exchange of intentions
in the reference network.  Working on this task, we created a prototype, which is the basis for further 
improvement and development.  We urge all programmers who are not indifferent to this problem to join 
forces for the release and development of such an application.
